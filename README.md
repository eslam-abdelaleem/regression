# Regression and Reservoir Computing Lecture Code
A few simulations I ran for a lecture I gave about regression, from simple linear regression, passing by regression methods like SINDy, ending by Reservoir Computing

This repository contains Python code developed for a lecture on regression methods, chaotic dynamics, and reservoir computing. The examples here are implemented using primarily NumPy, SciPy, and ReservoirPy libraries. Each example demonstrates various situations and methods covered in the lecture, from basic regression techniques to advanced applications like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and reservoir computing.
